# Lockboxes

## Description
This project involves determining if a series of locked boxes can be opened. Each box contains keys to other boxes, and the goal is to determine if all boxes can be opened starting from the first box, which is initially unlocked.

## Function Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    Determines if all boxes can be unlocked.

    :param boxes: A list of lists where each sublist contains keys to other boxes
    :return: True if all boxes can be unlocked, False otherwise
    """
